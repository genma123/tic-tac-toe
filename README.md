# Version of the ReactJS Intro Tutorial Using Redux and ImmutableJS
1. I created the project using [Create React App] (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
2. I pasted in the code from the [ReactJS Intro Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial] (https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) from CodePen
3. I modified to use Redux, using mostly [this post] (https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-build-a-todo-app-using-react-redux-and-immutable-js/) as a guide.
4. In order to incorporate Redux, I had to eject as per [this GitHub project] (https://github.com/tstringer/create-react-app-with-redux).
5. At this point, game play works however the history list of moves is not yet implemented.
